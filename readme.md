Trying for the first time to put all the knowledge all together, used blender for the 3D scene, photshop to change some textures, three.JS for the canvas and HTML/CSS to add the info text bubble.  
Fused everything with an animation event on city change and put a geolocalisation API + fetch on the first loading to get local position.

Was really fun to do, encountered lot of troubles but at the end i'm pretty happy with the result, will try to update it in the future with something more dynamic and responsiv.
